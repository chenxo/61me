For every assignment, navigate to “File –> Open -> labX”.
for Lab 1, you would select the lab01 directory inside your sp24-s*** repo.


Navigate to the “File -> Project Structure” menu, and make sure you are in 
the Project tab. Set your project SDK to your installed Java version.
[vp sp2021 uses 15]
If 17 or higher isn’t available in the dropdown, make sure you downloaded 
and installed Java completely.


Still in the Project tab, set the Project Language Level to [vp sp2021 iuses 15] 
“17 - Sealed types, always-strict floating-point semantics”.


The Compiler output is filled in, and is set to the assignment directory, followed by out
    ~/61me/lab2/out

Still in Project Structure, go to the Libraries tab. Click the “+ -> Java” 
button, then navigate to library-sp24, select the folder, and click “Ok”.
Click “Ok” to apply your settings and leave Project Structure.

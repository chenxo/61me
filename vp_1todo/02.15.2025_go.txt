if i work on 61b and complete the assignments
    ill be prepared for a few things i find valuable
        compilers, systems (concurrency via brown cs300, cs161/162)
            c programming (for the above)

        java, dsalgos

i have mooc.fi java course open as well
    might just download the netbeans and dig into it
        an almost parallel view, perhaps some nice variety of view and implementation

starting with schedule of assignments
    based on weekAssigned subgroup sort first
        then i have the subgroups sotred by dueDate if i get stuck or could use a different order
